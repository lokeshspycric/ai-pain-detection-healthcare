## ðŸ§  Pain Recognition AI â€“ Deep Learning for Healthcare

This project uses deep learning and transfer learning to detect pain from facial expressions, aimed at supporting medical professionals in assessing non-verbal patients. 
By leveraging a ResNet50 architecture and Focal Loss to handle severe class imbalance, the system achieves high-precision pain classification performance on the BP4D Spontaneous Dataset â€” a key step toward AI-assisted healthcare diagnostics.
